Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient wealth score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in Chapter 5: Wealth &amp; Equipment. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Fire Resistance, the GM may decide that the dragon&rsquo;s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor&rsquo;s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.</p>","effect":"","notes":"You can create extraordinary items"},"cost":3,"tier":"I-III","prerequisites":"Learning, Logic, or any Extraordinary 5","index":0},"flags":{},"img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/magic-axe.svg","effects":[],"_id":"A60oo0lueuEDqdUM"}

If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 3 </strong>- The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:</p>\n<p>If the chosen boon has a duration of \"sustain persists\", you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.

If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action.

In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the invocation was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous &amp; non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the nullify bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).</p>\n<p><strong>Bestow Bane </strong>- Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous &amp; non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be canceled either temporarily with the nullify bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Boon </strong>- Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the boon automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Bane </strong>- Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel.
