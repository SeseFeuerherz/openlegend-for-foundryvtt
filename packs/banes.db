For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead.</p>","effect":"","notes":""},"attributes":{"agility":false,"fortitude":false,"might":false,"learning":false,"logic":false,"perception":false,"will":false,"deception":false,"persuasion":false,"presence":false,"alteration":false,"creation":false,"energy":false,"entropy":false,"influence":false,"movement":false,"prescience":false,"protection":false},"action":{"name":"","attribute":"","cast_time":"1 Major","target":"","index":0},"persists":{"duration":"Resist (Failx3 = 1 Hour)"},"attacks":[{"attribute":"alteration","target":"Tough"}],"pl":"5/6/8/9"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/sheep.svg","effects":[],"_id":"uOlmoRqjt8zjqOad"}
